# Installation

This guide will walk you through the process of installing the Batch Rename Tool for Unreal Engine.

## Which edition to install?

The Batch Rename Tool is available in two editions: the Marketplace edition and the Source edition.

The **Source edition** contains the sources of the tool, but no precompiled binaries. This edition is totally free and
the sources are freely available on GitHub under the MIT license. This edition can be used by projects using C++ as well
as by those who know how to build the plugin.

The **Marketplace edition** contains the sources but also the precompiled binaries for your engine version. This edition
is available for a small fee on the Unreal marketplace and is also distributed under the MIT license. It can be used by
Blueprint-only projects, people who don't know how to use the source edition, or those who want to support development.

:::info

**Both editions contain the same features**. The features are not different from one edition to another, only the distribution mode.

## Installing the Marketplace edition

*WIP*

## Installing the Source edition

The Source edition is hosted on GitHub in the [FrozenStormInteractive/Unreal-Batch-Rename-Tool](https://github.com/FrozenStormInteractive/Unreal-Batch-Rename-Tool) repository.

The **main** branch contains the latest stable development. It does not necessarily contain the latest version, but it
is considered stable.

The **develop** branch contains the active development like upcoming features. It is not considered stable and
**should not** be used in production without any good reason.

For **stable versions**, we create releases available in the [Releases](https://github.com/FrozenStormInteractive/Unreal-Batch-Rename-Tool/releases) page of the repository. You can download them as an archive.

Once you have downloaded it, you can place the plugin in the Plugins folder (or one of its subfolders) of your project
if your project can compile C++ sources. You must then compile your project before launching the editor.

## Enabling the plugin
