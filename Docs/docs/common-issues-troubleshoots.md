# Common Issues and Troubleshooting

## Installation

### I don't know how to download the source edition or use it in my project

You can pay for the marketplace edition to have an easier installation and precompiled binaries (this also support the
development of the tool).

Otherwise, there is a lot of documentation and communities on the Internet ready to help you. Don't hesitate to ask them.
